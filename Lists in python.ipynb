    "Operations that are performed using data structures are: Read, Search, Insert and Delete.\n",

    "Examples of Data strucures observed in Python Programming Language are: List, Tuple, Dictionary and set."

If we tru to use  sum function in the nested list \"class_marks[2]\", we can run into errors!. A python Dictionary is a better solution to this problem. Hence it is important to use Data Structures as per requirement as one data structure alone cannot be efficient for all kinds of tasks."

    "## Q4) What is an algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: An algorithm is a set of instructions for completing a specifc task. Algorithms can be written in any programming Language. It is advisable to first write down an algorithm in the form of a pseudo code and the convert it to a programming language. This ensures that the simple logic behind an algorithm can be easily communicated to a wide audience before a programmer implements the algorithm in a known programming Language. Refer below for the example of a binary search algorithm coded in python language that is used to find search values in a large datset and converges to the answer in a less number of steps than a linear search."

    "## Q5) Time complexity of algorithms is measured in terms of steps instead of pure time. Why is that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Pure time may not be an accurate measure of performance because, performance time can vary from one machine to another machine. As pure time varies across machines, we can use \"number of steps\" to compute the efficiency of an algorithm. Measuring the speed of an operation is known as time complexity analysis. But one factor we constantly want to measure is \"Number of steps relative to the size of input 'N'.\" This is known as Big O Notation: How many steps relative to N elements. This is also called:\n",

    "“Order of N”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh of N”\n",
    "Using Big O Notation, we determine\"Number of steps taken by an algorithm for given N data elements.\"\n",
